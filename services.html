            <h4>Quick results</h4>
            <h5>1 -2 sessions (usually 2 - 6 hours)</h5>
            <h2>£35 per hour (£45-£50 per hour in London)</h2>
            <p>
              The goal is to make maximum impact on the space within the time we
              have. Often one or two sessions is enough to transform an
              averagely cluttered, smaller room or area. It is also a great idea
              to book this package if there is more to achieve but you want to
              get a picture of the process before committing. We can take up to
              a carload of items away following the sessions so that you see
              maximum benefits straight away. Some people just need a push in
              the right direction and then they can go on to achieve the rest of
              their decluttering and organising goals on their own.

            <h4>Real results</h4>
            <h5>3 -5 sessions (usually 9 - 20 hours)</h5>
            <h2>£30 per hour (£40 per hour in London)</h2>
            <p>
              Three to five sessions will usually take place over several
              weeks/months. We will be able to deal with a very heavily
              cluttered room or multiple rooms and make serious impact. The
              space will be completely transformed! We will implement simple but
              effective organising techniques to enable you maintain the
              changes. You might choose this package if you have a big job to do
              on a contained space such as a loft, cellar or garage.

              Six sessions plus is ideal to make noticeable and lasting changes
              to your entire home. We can achieve so much within this time!
              Obviously what is achieved will depend on how things were to start
              with but the aim would be to complete a significant amount of
              decluttering, provide you will expert organisational systems,
              change the way you run your home for the better and for your whole
              way of thinking to have evolved. You will feel far more
              comfortable and content in your home and you will feel the full
              benefits of going on a decluttering journey. If you want a more
              organised home, the change in mindset and habits is an important
              as the practical side so coaching will be a focus too. Don’t
              forget that we are committed to donating any of your unwanted
              items to charities and preventing as much as possible from going
              to landfill.
