        <h1>Best Tips for Organizing Your Home</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="tips-header-text">
        <p>
          There's no right way to organize your home. Whatever strategy you
          choose just has to work with your lifestyle, habits, and tastes. But
          there are a few tried-and-true strategies that can enhance the
          effectiveness of any system. From being aware of clutter hot spots to
          identifying red flags that your organizing method isn't working, we
          learned some smart approaches to getting organized from the pros so
          you can save the time, money, and stress that come with living in a
          den of disorder.

          Make everything a one-handed operation." For example, don't hide your
          laundry basket in the back of the closet. Instead, use an open bin
          that you can throw your clothes into from across the room. And avoid
          lids at almost all costs. Using open containers for things you use
          often like toiletries and cooking supplies makes it easier to put them
          away. This advice even applies to garbage cans. We recommends
          investing in one with a lever you can step on to pop the lid open. The
          fewer steps, the better the organizing system.

      <div class="tips-text-container">
        <p class="tips-text">
          When people want to get organized, the first thing they usually do is
          run out and buy storage supplies, but that's actually backwards. The
          point is to evaluate why you have so much stuff to begin with—not find
          new ways to house your junk. You won't have any idea of what you
          really need in terms of containers or shelving until you've purged.
          While deciding what to keep and what to toss, always remember the
          "80/20 rule". It's the theory that most of us only use 20 percent of
          what we have. That's a good starting point to realizing you are
          surrounded by a lot of things you probably don't need. Plus, not only
          will slimming down your stuff save you money on storage supplies, but
          it'll save you the headache of going through excess items in an
          emergency or last-minute situation.

          If a room still somehow looks messy after you've cleaned, it's time to
          improve your organizational system, which should allow you to tidy up
          in 15 minutes or less. Once you've pulled out what you don't need—to
          either throw away or donate—the next step is to group things together
          based on use or occasion and store them in open containers.

        <p class="tips-text">
          There isn't a drawer in your house that should not have container
          organizers in them. They can be any material you want—wood, wire mesh
          or clear plastic—and are available at most home goods stores. This
          allows you to separate the drawers into defined areas for specific
          things verses throwing everything into one big space. For the bedroom,
          store everyday items—like underwear and socks—in top drawers, workout
          clothes in the second or third drawers and pants in the bottom
          drawers. In the bathroom, keep cotton swabs and other daily use items
          on the counter within arm's reach, and tools you use occasionally
          under the cabinet. With the things you only use now and then separated
          out and away from the things you need every day, those daily
          essentials will be better organized and easier to get to.

          Flat surfaces like your dining room table, entryway table and kitchen
          counters tend to accumulate piles faster than any other spot in the
          house the advises is to make clearing all flat surfaces part of the
          nightly routine—right along with washing the face and brushing the
          teeth. But if that doesn't work the last-ditch trick is to physically
          block any surface that has become a clutter haven. For instance, if
          you put a flower arrangement in the middle of the dining room table
          and set it with placemats, you're sending the message that the space
          is no longer a dumping zone.

          When you're ready to roll up your sleeves and take on an organizing
          project, follow these steps to restore (and keep!) order: First, do it
          in one shot. Set up a staging area, like the dining table, then empty
          whatever you're organizing so you can spot doubles, giveaways, and
          must-saves fast. Then use organizers like clear containers and baskets
          without lids so you can quickly access what's left of your pared-down
          collection. Lastly, label everything—even if you think you'll
          remember, mark boxes and bins with easy-to-read descriptions so
          there's no second-guessing later on.

          Keep the items you use every day in plain sight—or at least at eye

          the things you use once in a while should require a step stool. This
          is where high shelving comes in handy. Things you use only once a year
          should require a ladder. (Think attics or out-of-reach shelving in a
          garage.) Not only will this storage system make it easier for you to
          find the things you use often, but the items you don't use regularly
          will stay organized until you need them.

          Often clutter becomes such a fixture, you look right past it. For a
          new perspective, imagine you're a guest in your own home. Take note of
          things a visitor would notice that you've been ignoring, like the
          paper pile that has claimed the corner of the kitchen counter for
          months or the blankets strewn all over the couch. Then, refresh the
          room back to its original state by eliminating what's making it appear
          disorganized. Still not seeing the junk? Snapping a picture of the
          room will force you to view your space through a different lens.

            Trying to determine what can stay and what should go? If at least
            one of the following statements is true about an item, then it's a
            keeper:
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>I've used it within the last year</strong>. That's enough
            time to have gone through all four seasons and special occasions. If
            you still aren't sure, put the item in a "Donate Later" box, seal it
            and mark it with the date of one year from now. If you haven't
            opened it by then, drop off the box at Goodwill without peeking
            inside.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>I need it or I love it</strong>. If you don't, there's no
            real reason to hang on to it. Resolve to fill your space only with
            things that really work, give you pleasure or celebrate your family.
            Remember that you can't appreciate what you have if it's hiding in a
            dark corner of a closet. You should frame or display what you deem
            worth holding on to.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>It fits into the life I want to live</strong>. If something
            supports you and your future goals (think exercise equipment or a
            book about starting a business), it can stay. If it's a painful
            reminder of the past (think clothes that don't fit anymore or items
            that belonged to an ex), let it go.
